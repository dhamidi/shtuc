* Description

=shtuc= makes managing software configuration easy by not requiring you
to think.  Like =git config=, it just does The Right Thingâ„¢.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ shtuc database/host localhost
 $ shtuc database/host
localhost
 $ shtuc now run date
 $ shtuc now
Thu Dec 12 02:31:02 CET 2013
 $ find .shtuc.d -type f
.shtuc.d/database/host
.shtuc.d/now
#+END_SRC

For details, see =man 1 shtuc=.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 # Install in /usr/local
 $ make test
 $ sudo make install
#+END_SRC

The default installation location is =/usr/local=.  If you want to
install =shtuc= somewhere else, set =PREFIX=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 # Install somewhere else
 $ PREFIX=/tmp make install
#+END_SRC

* Customization

By default, =shtuc= looks for configuration settings in a directory
called =.shtuc.d=.  It first checks for this directory in the current
directory, then in the parent git repository (if currently in one) and
then in a few other locations.  This list is actually generated by
=shtuc-path=, so by providing your own version of =shtuc-path= you can
completely change the directories that are searched.

When writing settings, only the first line of output of =shtuc-path= is
taken into account.  This way changes are as narrowly scoped as
possible.

If a file named =.shtuc/unkown= exists in one of the directories listed
by =shtuc-path=, the value of this file is used for any unknown
variables.  Making this file executable allows for dynamic generation of
values, similar to ruby's =method_missing=.

* Ideas

Since everything is just a file, new features can easily be added by
just using standard tools:
- make configuration accessible over the network by running a httpd in
  =.shtuc.d=
- track configuration changes using git
- encrypt sensitive data using gpg
